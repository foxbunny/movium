# Movium

Movium is an implementation of the MVU architecture (a.k.a.
[Elm architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/)) in JavaScript.
This package provides the base framework built on top of
[Snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom) as well as set of prototypes
and functions that can be used as a recommendation to build applications on top
of it.

We say 'recommendation' because, as you will see, most of the extra bits and
pieces are not required to implement an MVU application on top of Movium.

This framework is currently in an experimental phase, and the API may change
from time to time. Do not expect a stable release until version `1.0.0`.
